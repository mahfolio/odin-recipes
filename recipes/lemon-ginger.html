    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ginger lemon water is my favorite remedy for colds or when I 
        have a sore throat or just not feeling well. This delicious 
        water is infused with fresh ginger, lemon juice, and sweetened
         with raw honey. Although I drink it usually warm it’s also 
         good cold, with ice cubes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>Here’s what you need to make lemon ginger water:
        <li>fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>fresh ginger</li>
        <li>raw honey</li>
        <li>water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the ginger and cut it into very thin slices.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger to a cup and add 1 cup of boiling water. Let
             steep for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add honey and stir until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger honey liquid into a large pitcher. Add lemon
             juice and the remaining 2 1/2 cups of warm water (just 
             water that is pleasantly warm to drink, I like to use 1 1/2
              cups of tap water and 1 cup of almost boiling water to get
               a good temperature). Stir to combine.</li>
    </ol>
